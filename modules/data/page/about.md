# about

## this site

This site is built using a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/):

- Javascript -- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) pre-rendering with a progressive SPA
- APIs -- a self-hosted [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/) webapp leverages a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) backend on [Github](https://github.com/) to provide a CMS
- Markup -- there's markup involved! Lots of it! The build process consumes markdown from the CMS and outputs HTML.
